        <p>This hackathon is aimed for intermediate and expert programmers. Beginners can also join but they will act as judge (and executioner).</p>

<p>Participating Pythonistas should be at the venue by 9AM and Beginners (who will judge the players) must be at the venue by 4PM.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, after 3 straight meetups aimed at beginners, the Philippines Python User Group is proud to announce a meetup that non-beginners can enjoy.</p>

<p>This hackathon will start at 9AM and will end at 5PM, an eight hour session of coding amongst like-minded Pythonistas. Anyone can join and groupings are encouraged. You can group with your friends or you can make a group at the event.</p>

<p>The hackathon has the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your group will be given a list of words.</li>
<li>Select 3 words.</li>
<li>Make an application that is described by 3 words.</li>
<li>Be creative!</li>
<li>At the deadline, players will give a presentation and will be judged.</li>
<li>Be creative with your presentation. Wow the judges.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3>Why should you join?</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a non-beginner, you should join so that you can put your skills to the test. You can push yourself into becoming a better coder. In addition, you will be surrounded by other programmers. You can learn a lot if you are in the same room as like-minded Pythonistas.</li>
<li>As a beginner, this is your chance to see how programmers work. In addition, you can get a chance to learn what it takes to be a Pythonista.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is there free drinks?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes. The coffee, tea and water are free-flowing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is there free lunch?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, but only for those who arrived early. The earlier you are, the better chance you have in getting free lunch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What will we use for coding?</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is a BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) event. But if you don't have a computer, we will see if we can accommodate you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is this really an 8 hour coding session?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, but we're sure you'll going to use up 2 hours in planning, 2 hour in coding, and 5 hours talking with awesome Pythonistas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Will programming in this hackathon be hard?</h3>

<ul>
<li>No. This hackathon is designed so you can code a solution in less than 2 hours. Trying to think of a solution, on the other hand, depends entirely on how creative you are.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I heard there will be lions.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
